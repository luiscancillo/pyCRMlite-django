###pyCRMlite-Django

pyCRMlite-Django is just an example of implementing a simple backend web application including
a set of common artifacts which can be found in many web applications: static web 
pages, templates which are rendered with data collected from a database, graphs 
generated from data in the database, etc.

The specific aspect of this project is that the Django framework has been used for its
implementation.

As this repository includes other projects where the same web application is 
implemented using other frameworks, they can be used to compare them and to analyze
implications from the point of view of the development process, and even performances.

In this repository it is not included information for deploying the application in a
production environment with a web server like Apache or IIS.

Full Doxygen html documentation can be found in the doc directory.
